### Live website
The demo can be found at: [AP Analysis](http://www.meilleursjeux.net/APAnalysis)


### The project
AP Analysis is a tool where you can discover throught graphs and statistics the impact of the change on AP items. 
This project is divided in three parts:

1) Framework to parse the data .json files

2) Website creation

3) A deep analysis about this impact

More information on [About page](http://www.meilleursjeux.net/APAnalysis/about/)

### Technologies used

* Server Code: Haxe
* Database: Mysql
* Template Website: BootStrap
* Graphic Library: Chartjs

### TODO List

Compare all regions (parse the rest of the data)

Use the timelines events (I will probably say the Mage have an advantage in the early game)

Dig deeper into the use of AP items

Create the interactive website (live)
